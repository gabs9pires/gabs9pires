### Hi there, I'm Gabriela PiresðŸ‘‹
I've been working with QA since 2017, I've started in this area with a internship and have been here since. I have knowledge in the all test process like planning, execution, documeting, results analysis and regression.

At moment I'm working with mobile test but for the most part of my career I worked with web test. Also have experince in both manual test and automation test

Used to work in agile teams! I don't now how to work without a kanban (just kidding :sweat_smile:) 

Have a technical degree in IT and I'm currently studing Data Science at Univesp
A curious person always trying to learn something new :mag_right:
